Use ADD VERTEX button to ad new vertices to manupulate
Use DELETE VERTEX button and cklick a vertex to delete it
Use MANAGE EDGES button to add or remove edges. Click the button then two different vertices to use
Use GET ADJACENCY MATRIX, GET EDJACENCY LIST and GET EDGE LIST buttons to see the corresponding parameter of the graph
Use LOAD ADJACENCY MATRIX button to upload* a graph from an adjacency matrix. You must input it row by row. 0 menas an absence of edge, any other number neans thet there is an edge of a certain length**. All brackets are ignored
Use LOAD ADJACENCY LIST button to upload* a graph from an adjacency list. Input format must be [[(<first vertex to connect with vertex 1>, <length** of the edge>), (<second vertex to connect with vertex 1>, <length** of the edge>), ...], [(<first vertex to connect with vertex 2>, <length** of the edge>), (<second vertex to connect with vertex 2>, <length** of the edge>), ...], ...]
Use LOAD EDGE LIST button to upload* a groph from an edge list. Input format must be [(<start of the edge 1>, <end of the edge 1>, <length** of the edge 1>), (<start of the edge 2>, <end of the edge 2>, <length** of the edge 2>), ...]
Toggling DIRECTED EDGES button changes the way the graph is displayed and separates edges of format (vertex 1, vertex 2) (vertex 2, vertex 1)
*All the vertices and edges created are deleted after uploading a graph
**length of an edge does not influency anything yet
